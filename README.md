B.Sc. thesis in electronic engineering, "Analysis of multipaction effect in S-band components for particle accelerators"

Here you'll find my B.Sc. thesis in electronic engineering, "Analysis of multipaction effect in S-band components for particle accelerators", regarding the study of the multipaction effect in waveguide-based components employed for RF power distribution in particle accelerators.

I've also included a short powerpoint presentation used for the discussion that briefly illustrates the analysis performed and gives visual insight of the phenomenon.
